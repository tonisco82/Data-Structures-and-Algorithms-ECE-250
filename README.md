# ECE-250 | Data Structures and Alrogithms

**Project 1** - Designed, implemented, and tested a Double-Ended Queue data structure using a doubly linked list.

**Project 2** - Designed, implemented, and tested a Hash Table data structure using both linear probing and double hashing.

**Project 3** - Designed, implemented, and tested a Quadtree data structure used to manage a map of cities.

**Project 4** - Designed, implemented, and tested a Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's Algorithm with disjoint sets.

**Project 5** - Designed, implemented, and tested an Undirected Graph data structure using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
